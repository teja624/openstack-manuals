Cross-references
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To cross-reference to arbitrary locations within one document,
use the ``ref`` role:

**Input**

.. code::

   .. _cg_titles:

   Titles
   ~~~~~~

   This is the section we want to reference to.

   ...

   The following - :ref:`cg_titles` - generates a link to the section with
   the defined label using this section heading as a link title.

   A link label and a reference can be defined in separate source files,
   but within one directory. Otherwise, use the external linking.

**Output**

External references
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To link to some external locations, format the RST source as follows:

* Do not apply any markups to specify a web link.

* If you need a specific link title to appear in the output,
  format a web link as ``Link text <http://web-link.com>``
  wrapping it in backticks.

* Do not separate a link name from a link itself by defining the link in other
  place in your document. It prevents translated documents from using different
  links, for example, corresponding links to translated versions.

   Here is an external web link with a link title:
  `User guide <http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/>`_.
